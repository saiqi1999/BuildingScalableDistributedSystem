DEPLOY .war FILE ON TOMCAT AS HW2_server.war TO GET RECOGNIZED

YOU ALSO NEED TO CONFIGURE REMOTE RABBITMQ SERVER BY ADDING username "alapaka" password "123456"

CLI for client:\
-i {loadbalancer ip} -n {skier num} -t {thread num} -m {mean ride num}\
e.g.\
-i hw2alb-1506383268.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com -n 20000 -t 128 -m 10\

Thanks!
